# razer-soundboard
 
## Purpose
The purpose of this program is to give the ability for Razer users to use their numpad as a soundboard.

## Usage
To use this program, simply run the main.py in a terminal, or set a Razer Hypershift key to open the compiled program. Once opened, you can configure each of the numpad keys (0-9) using the included GUI. This program supports playing audio in formats such as `PCM, WAV. MP3, AAC, OGG, WMA, FLAC, ALAC`. 

### **\*It is highly recommended to compile the program for your system using `pyinstaller -F main.py` in the project main directory.\***

To close the program, either close the window or press the `DEL` or `.` key to the right of the `0` numpad key.

## TODO
- Improve GUI
